# RL-Algorithms-and-Optimisation
The repository contains the beginner Reinforcement Learning algorithms dealing with the Exploration vs Exploitation dilemma, which are:
* Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm
* UCB Algorithm
* KL-UCB Algorithm
* Thompson Sampling Algorithm

# Running and executing the algorithms
All of the classes, algorithms and useful functions are implemented in the file ```submission/bandit.py```.
